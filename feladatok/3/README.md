# Overview

This repository contains a series of programming exercises designed to practice and apply fundamental concepts. These tasks were part of university assignments focused on mastering essential skills such as class creation, file handling, and exception management.

## Task Summary

The tasks in this repository, though simple, are crucial for building a strong foundation in programming. They cover key concepts such as object-oriented design, file manipulation, and exception handling, providing hands-on experience in core programming techniques.

### Key Concepts Practiced:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling
- File Input/Output (I/O)
- Collections (Lists, Maps)
- Basic Data Manipulation

This project serves as a practical collection of exercises that reinforce foundational programming principles. Each task is aimed at developing key skills necessary for tackling common programming challenges, particularly in file handling, exception management, and object-oriented design. The repository also acts as a useful reference for understanding structured approaches to solving programming problems.
