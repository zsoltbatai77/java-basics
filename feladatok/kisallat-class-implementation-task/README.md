# KisAllat Class Implementation Task

The task involves implementing several methods and other functions in the `KisAllat` class. The class contains the following attributes: `nev`, `csipSzam`, `tulajokSzama`, and `boldogNapok`. The tasks include a method that returns the value of the happiest day, which will be 0 if the `boldogNapok` map is empty or `null`. Additionally, a `rendez` method must be implemented, which takes an array of small animals and sorts them in descending order based on their happiness level. In case of equal happiness levels, it should sort them alphabetically by `csipSzam`. If the array is empty or null, it should return an empty collection. The small animals should be compared using the `compareTo` method. Furthermore, a `teddBoldogga` method is required, which removes animals that have happy days from the provided list and invokes the `addBoldognap` method for animals without a happy day.
