# File Management System Task

The goal of the task is to implement a file management system capable of uploading and handling files in different folders. The system consists of the following classes: `FileSystemEntry`, which is the abstract class providing the common properties and methods for the elements, such as returning the full path; `Folder`, which can contain other files or folders and manages their accessibility; `File`, which contains file-specific data and related methods; `Namer`, an interface that defines how files should be renamed; `SequentialNamer`, which appends a number to the file name every time a new file is uploaded; `RandomNamer`, which generates a random string to modify the file names; `Manager`, which organizes files into the appropriate folders based on their type (e.g., images or other files) and ensures the correct name and location in the system. The system organizes the files into `images` and `etc` folders, placing images and other files into separate directories, then renames the files using the corresponding `Namer` implementation. After uploading, the system outputs the file's path and the total size of the folders.
