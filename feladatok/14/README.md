# Vállalkozás and Vásárló Class Implementation Task

In the solution, the `Vállalkozás` class investment collection must be modified so that identical amounts of money are stored in different places, such as by using a `List` or `Map`. In the `penztKolt()` method, the exception thrown should be replaced with a custom exception class, while ensuring the error message remains unchanged. In the `Vásárló` class, the constructor sets the customer's name and ID number, initially setting their amount of money to zero. The `getPenz()` method returns the customer's money, while the `penztKolt()` method deducts the spending amount from the customer's money and throws an appropriate exception if there is insufficient funds. The `vagyontKiszamit()` method modifies the customer's money based on a file, where each line contains the date, the type of money movement (REVENUE or EXPENSE), and the amount. In the common section task, because there is overlap in money management and spending in the `Vásárló` and `Vállalkozás` classes, an interface must be created, which both classes will implement, allowing for the reuse of common code.
