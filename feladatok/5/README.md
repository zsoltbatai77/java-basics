# Csavarhuzo and CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo Class Task

The task is to create a `Csavarhuzo` (Screwdriver) class, which represents a screwdriver. The class has attributes for size and the type of screw head. The screw head can be flathead, Phillips, or hex, which are defined using an enumeration type. The screwdriver class includes getters, setters, and a `toString` method that returns a textual description based on the type of screw head.

The `CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo` (Interchangeable Head Screwdriver) class is an extended version of the screwdriver, where the screw head is interchangeable. Initially, all heads are available, but one can be removed using a method. Another method allows the screw head to be replaced, provided the new head is available and differs from the current one. When returning the size, the screw head size does not count.
