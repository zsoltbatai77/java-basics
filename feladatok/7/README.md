# Media System with Age Rating Task

The goal of the task is to implement a media system with an age rating classification that handles various media types such as TV shows, music tracks, video tapes, and series. The system uses the `BesorolassalRendelkezo` interface, which provides a method for retrieving the age rating. The `TVMusor` class is used to handle TV shows, where each show has a name and duration. The duration attribute cannot be negative, and this must be checked both in the constructor and setter methods. The `Zeneszam` class represents a music track, with an artist, title, and lyrics, and contains a `getKorhatarBesorolas` method, which calculates the age rating based on the number of curse words in the lyrics. The list of curse words is provided by a predefined vocabulary, and each occurrence increases the age rating. The `VideoMagno` class represents a video tape player, which can play various media types and checks if the required age rating for playback is within the user's age. If the age rating exceeds the user's age, the system will display a message stating that playback is not possible. If the media type is a series and the user's age is appropriate, the system will display the name of the series; if it is a music track, the system will show the title and artist of the song. The `Sorozat` class handles series, where each episode has an age rating, and the maximum age rating for the series is calculated based on the highest rating of its episodes. The `getKorhatarBesorolas` method for series returns the highest episode age rating. The implementation in each class ensures correct usage of attributes and methods and guarantees that the age rating and playback functionality work properly in the system.
