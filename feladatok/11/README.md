# Food Delivery System Task

The task involves creating a system for managing food delivery couriers, which includes three classes: an abstract `EtelFutar` class and two derived classes, `AutosFutar` and `KerekparosFutar`. The `EtelFutar` class contains basic attributes such as speed and value, as well as an abstract method `idobenErkezik`, which determines whether the courier arrives on time. The `AutosFutar` class has additional attributes such as energy, with getter and setter methods. The `idobenErkezik` method in this class takes the time of day into account; if it is "del" (noon) or "este" (evening), it reduces the speed. Then, based on the distance and speed, it calculates the required time and compares it with the available time, returning the appropriate value. The `KerekparosFutar` class sets the initial speed and energy based on default values, and the energy level affects the speed. The amount of food also affects the speed: if the food weighs more than 5 kg, every full 5 kg reduces the speed. In addition, the energy level decreases based on the distance. The `idobenErkezik` method calculates the required time and compares it with the available time. The proper functionality of the classes ensures that couriers of different types (car and bicycle) perform tasks according to the specified conditions, considering time, speed, energy, and food quantity.
