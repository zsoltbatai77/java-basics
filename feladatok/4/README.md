# SovenyvagoOllo and Bokor Class Task

The task is to create `SovenyvagoOllo` (Shears) and `Bokor` (Bush) classes. The sharpness of the shears can range from 0 to 100, with the default value set to 100. The shears are used to trim bushes, which decreases their sharpness, and can be sharpened back to their original state. The `Bokor` class stores the type, density, and shape of the bush, with the shape taking a value between 0 and 4. The bush can grow, changing its shape, and can be trimmed to shape using the shears.
