# Video and Szoveg Class Implementation Task

In the `Video` class, the collection of tags must be modified so that each tag appears only once, by using a Set. In the `valogat()` method, instead of throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`, a custom exception class must be created. In the `Szoveg` class, the constructor sets the title, content, and file name, with an initial yield value of 0. The `valogat()` method filters the words in the title based on the length received as a parameter, and if the title contains the word "false," it throws an exception. The `hozamKiszamit()` method calculates the yield from the content of the file. A common interface is needed, which will be implemented by both the `Video` and `Szoveg` classes. In the `Hirportal` class, visitor management takes place: new visitors can be added, their interest can be reduced, and they can be sorted by name or interest. The breakdown of yearly income must be calculated based on a list of `Szoveg` type objects and visitor data.
