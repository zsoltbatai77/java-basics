# Shopping List Management System Task

The goal of the task is to implement a shopping list management system that can handle products, favorite stores, best purchase opportunities, and extreme shopping needs using different classes. The first class, `Product`, represents a product and contains its name, price, category, and importance, along with getter and setter methods. The `ShoppingList` class manages the products to be purchased, ensuring the ability to add, remove, count, and display them. The `FavouriteShopSet` class stores the user's favorite stores and provides functionality to manage them, such as adding, removing, and searching. The `BestPriceFinder` class helps determine which store offers the best purchase opportunities for a specific product and also allows for deleting a store. Finally, the `ExtremeShopping` class caters to the needs of extreme shoppers by allowing shopping lists to be grouped by store and displayed. When implementing these classes, special attention must be given to the correct use of data types and visibility, as well as the proper functioning of operations on lists, sets, and mappings.
