# Investigator Class Task

The task is to create a `Nyomoz√≥` (Investigator) class that represents a detective with various attributes and methods. The class includes the detective's name, a list of suspects, and clues, as well as methods such as using clues, excluding suspects, sorting clues, and checking alibis. During the investigation, the detective analyzes the available clues and tries to identify the culprit based on them. The task also includes a special method to help the detective clear their name if they become a suspect themselves.
