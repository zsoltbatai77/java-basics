# Basketball Team and Player Management System Task

The task involves creating a system for managing basketball teams and players, which includes storing player data (name, position, age, height, weight), assigning players to team positions, and recording matches and their results between teams. The `Játékos` class contains player attributes, while the `Csapat` class manages the players and their positions, as well as calculating the average height and weight of the team. The `Meccs` class determines the results of the matches between teams based on their statistics and selects the winning team. The `Liga` class is responsible for creating teams and organizing matches, including filtering out incomplete teams and saving the results to a CSV file. The system manages the data for individual teams and players while handling match operations and determining the winners.
